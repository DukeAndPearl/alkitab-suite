Just something on my minds or from the user feedback
that could improve Alkitab Bible Study

in no particular order

- [GUI] Alternative HTML viewer: xhtml (flying sourcer), XULEmbed, JDIC native browser, JWebPane (preferred, but not available yet)

  fa = Farsi (Done, thanks Peter von Kaehne)
  vi = Vietnamese (Done, thanks Daniel Owens)
- [Installer] Mac OSX dmg, need community help to build the dmg installer
