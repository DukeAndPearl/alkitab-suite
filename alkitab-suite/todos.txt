Just something on my minds that could improve Alkitab Bible Study, 
in no particular order
- [API] Open more public API for plugins/extension (On going progress)
- [GUI] Alternative HTML viewer: xhtml (flying sourcer), XULEmbed, JDIC native browser, JWebPane (preferred, but not available yet)
- [i18n] Internationalization or Localization for Alkitab Bible Study,
  in_ID = Indonesian (Done)
  fa = Farsi (Done, thanks Peter von Kaehne)
  vi = Vietnamese (Done, thanks Daniel Owens)
- [Installer] Mac OSX dmg, need community help to build the dmg installer
- [SWORD] Indonesian Bible Translation, require LAI (http://www.alkitab.or.id) permission,
  LAI is the copyright owner. (Done, Rejected by LAI)
- [SWORD] Indonesian Bible Translation, create my own translation :)
- Search highlight
- Configurable font and font color
